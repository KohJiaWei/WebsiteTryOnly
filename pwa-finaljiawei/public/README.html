DISCLAIMER: As you read my code, Sometimes, I will add comments for codes that I do not understand. 


These comments explaining the code may or may not be correct and 


there will be syntaxes such as !important in the style.css file


that I do not understand why it is not recommended to use. 


If you find that I am going in the wrong train of thought


please correct me as I am still a beginner. Thank you
